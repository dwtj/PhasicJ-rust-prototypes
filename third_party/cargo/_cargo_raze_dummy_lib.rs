// This empty Rust library exists to support `cargo-raze`. The `cargo-raze` tool
// is used to make cargo dependencies available to Bazel targets. It is
// implemented as a cargo subcommand and it is configured using a `Cargo.toml`
// file. This `Cargo.toml` conventionally declares a "fake" Rust library. This
// empty Rust file is that "fake" Rust library.
