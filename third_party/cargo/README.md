Bazel files in this package and subpackages were synthesized with `cargo-raze`
to make Cargo dependencies available to Bazel targets.


## Synthesizing Bazel Files With `cargo-raze`

The `cargo-raze` Cargo subcommand is used to interpret this directory's
`Cargo.toml` file and synthesize two kinds of Bazel files:

- A `crates.bzl` file which declares Bazel external repositories. (See the the
  synthesized `http_archive` rules in the `crates.bzl` file for details.)
- Various `Build.bazel` files which define Bazel targets representing Cargo-
  provided Rust dependencies. (See the synthesized `rust_library` rules in the
  `Build.bazel` files for details.)

Before we can synthesize these files, `cargo-raze` subcommand was installed
locally via

```
$ cargo install cargo-raze
```

Then `cargo-raze` was used to synthesize these Bazel files invoking

```
$ cargo raze
```

from within the `third_party/cargo/` directory.


## Using Synthesized Bazel Files

To fetch Cargo crates as Bazel external repositories, the Bazel `WORKSPACE` file
calls the `raze_fetch_remote_crates()` rule in `crates.bzl`:

```
load("//third_party/cargo:crates.bzl", "raze_fetch_remote_crates")
raze_fetch_remote_crates()
```

The Bazel `rust_library` rule and friends can depend upon the `rust_library`
rules generated by `cargo-raze`. For example, a PhasicJ project `BUILD.bazel`
file might define a `rust_binary` which depends upon a Cargo dependency:

```
rust_binary(
    name = "mycrate",
    srcs = ["main.rs"],
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
    edition = "2018",
    deps = [
        "//third_party/cargo:typenum",
    ],
)
```


## N.B.

`cargo-raze` can be used in two different "genmodes": "Vendored" and "Remote".
This project uses the latter for style reasons and to get simple dependency
patching support.
